    <h1>Community Reinvestment Act & Climate Concerns in New York City</h1>
    <h2>By Ashley Halloran</h2>
    <p>This project explores historic redlining, current community reinvestment areas, and climate vulnerability through a series of maps.</p>

    <p>This map visualizes the Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) “Residential Security” maps developed in the 1930s, which graded neighborhoods from A (“Best”) to D (“Hazardous”) based on racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic characteristics. Areas graded D—commonly outlined in red—were largely home to Black, immigrant, and working-class populations. These neighborhoods were effectively cut off from mortgage lending and other forms of investment, contributing to decades of disinvestment and structural inequality. The map offers a foundational view of spatialized racial discrimination, showing how federal housing policy institutionalized segregation and wealth stratification in urban America.</p>

    <p>This map displays current census tracts that qualify for community development & reinvestment under the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) of 1977, a federal law designed to encourage financial institutions to meet the credit needs of low- and moderate-income neighborhoods (and a policy repsonse to redlining). Many of these CRA-eligible tracts overlap with areas previously redlined, indicating a legacy of underinvestment that persists across generations. The map invites viewers to consider how historical spatial injustice continues to shape eligibility for federal reinvestment programs, and how financial institutions are now mandated to correct past harms—albeit imperfectly.</p>

    <p>This final map visualizes the Floodplain Social Hazard Risk Index (FSHRI), which quantifies vulnerability on a scale from 1 (low risk) to 5 (high risk) by combining flood exposure with social vulnerability metrics such as income, age, linguistic isolation, and housing status. High FSHRI scores appear disproportionately in historically marginalized neighborhoods—often those that were redlined and are now CRA-eligible. This map encapsulates the compounding risks faced by communities at the intersection of racialized disinvestment and climate threats, underscoring the need for reinvestment strategies that are both equitable and climate-conscious.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>These maps not only serve as a visualization of historical injustice but also prompt critical questions about the effectiveness of past policy interventions like the CRA. It underscores the need for future reinvestment strategies to incorporate environmental risk metrics to ensure that climate adaptation and economic justice are pursued in tandem.</p>
